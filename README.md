## Monte Carlo Simulations
___

Goal of the project is to compare experimental and simulated data results of molecular magnetic complex. The numerical Monte Carlo simulation method is used with the ALPS package. The simulation algorithm was defined by the exchange interactions between atoms and the Ising model of the nearest neighbors (NN) in the respective lattices of one-dimensional chain and two-dimensional ladder, based on temperature-dependant variational approach. 

The motivation to undertake this issue is the study of the magnetization properties, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility for the first spin ladder Co(NCS)2 and the next one from the group of low-temperature magnetics.
